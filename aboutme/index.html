    <p>I have many Hobbies that I invest my time into, and that have a hand in the work I do as well. I love drones! I am currently building a couple of them to use in competitions. Whats nice about drones is that there are so many ways to use them. for excample, in the work that I do, we use drones to take scans of buildings and objects and then take that information and make a 3D model off of it. </p>
